# Codebase Indexing Solution Design with Model Context Protocol and Chat Frontend

## Objective
Design a Python-based system to index a codebase, parse it with Tree-sitter, chunk code while preserving hierarchical and relational context, embed chunks in a Qdrant vector database for quick search, and leverage Neo4j for Graph RAG with bidirectional pointers to enable accurate, context-aware retrieval. The system includes a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server endpoint as a standardized interface for LLMs to query and retrieve codebase knowledge, supporting both cloud-based AI models (e.g., via APIs) and local AI models (e.g., Ollama). A React-based chat application frontend enables testing, codebase search, and visualization of graph relationships, plugging into the MCP server for querying and accessing codebase knowledge.

## Key Features
1. **Tree-sitter Parsing**: Parse source code into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), extracting functions, classes, and methods recursively.
2. **Structured Chunking**: Create chunks with metadata preserving parent-child and caller-callee relationships (bidirectional pointers).
3. **Embedding Generation**: Support cloud-based AI models (e.g., CodeBERT via API) and local AI models (e.g., Ollama with `codegemma`) for embedding chunks.
4. **Qdrant Vector Database**: Store embeddings and metadata for fast similarity search.
5. **Neo4j Graph Database**: Store chunk relationships for Graph RAG and graph visualization.
6. **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server**: Provide a standardized API endpoint for LLMs to query the codebase, integrating cloud and local models, and delivering context-aware results.
7. **Chat Application Frontend**: Develop a React-based frontend with a chat interface for querying and a graph view for entity relationships, connected to the MCP server.
8. **Dynamic LLM Integration**: Enable LLMs to consume the MCP server for query processing and context retrieval.
9. **Scalability and Extensibility**: Support large codebases and multiple languages with configurable chunking rules.

## Solution Overview Plan

### 1. Codebase Parsing with Tree-sitter
- **Tool**: Use `tree-sitter` with language-specific grammars (e.g., `tree-sitter-python`).
- **Process**:
  - Traverse the codebase directory to identify source files (e.g., `.py`, `.js`).
  - Parse each file into an AST using Tree-sitter.
  - Extract nodes for functions, classes, and methods recursively.
  - Use Tree-sitter queries to identify function calls for caller-callee relationships.
- **Output**: AST nodes with metadata (file path, line numbers, node type, call targets).

### 2. Recursive Chunking with Bidirectional Pointers
- **Chunk Definition**:
  - Chunks are semantically meaningful units (e.g., functions, classes, methods).
  - Each chunk includes:
    - **Content**: Raw code text.
    - **Metadata**:
      - File path, start/end line numbers.
      - Node type (e.g., `function_definition`, `class_definition`).
      - Parent node (e.g., class for a method).
      - Calls (functions called by this chunk).
      - Called_by (functions that call this chunk).
- **Bidirectional Pointers**:
  - Store `parent` for upward navigation (e.g., method to class).
  - Store `calls` and `called_by` for lateral navigation (e.g., function to called functions).
  - Represent relationships in Neo4j as graph edges.
- **Output**: Chunks with hierarchical and relational metadata.

### 3. Embedding Generation with Cloud and Local AI Models
- **Models**:
  - **Cloud AI Models**: Use cloud-based models like CodeBERT or UniXcoder via APIs (e.g., xAI’s API, Hugging Face Inference API).
  - **Local AI Models**: Use Ollama with code-specific models (e.g., `codegemma`, `codellama`) running locally.
- **Process**:
  - Provide a configurable interface to select cloud or local model for embedding.
  - For cloud models:
    - Send chunk content to the API, retrieve embeddings.
    - Handle API rate limits and authentication.
  - For local models:
    - Use Ollama’s API to generate embeddings locally.
    - Optimize for GPU/CPU usage.
  - Optionally concatenate metadata (e.g., node type, parent name) with chunk content for context-aware embeddings.
  - Batch process embeddings for efficiency.
- **Output**: Vector embeddings linked to chunk metadata.

### 4. Qdrant Vector Database
- **Role**: Store embeddings for fast similarity search.
- **Process**:
  - Store embeddings with metadata (file path, line numbers, node type, parent, calls, called_by) in Qdrant.
  - Use cosine similarity for indexing and querying.
  - Leverage Qdrant’s high-performance vector search for quick retrieval.
- **Output**: A searchable vector database of embeddings and metadata.

### 5. Neo4j Graph Database for Graph RAG and Visualization
- **Role**: Store chunk relationships for context-aware retrieval and graph visualization.
- **Graph Structure**:
  - **Nodes**: Chunks (functions, classes, methods) with properties (content, metadata).
  - **Edges**:
    - Parent-child relationships (e.g., class to method, weight: 1.0).
    - Caller-callee relationships (e.g., function to called function, bidirectional, weight: 0.5).
- **Graph RAG Process**:
  - Perform vector search in Qdrant to retrieve top-k chunks.
  - Query Neo4j to traverse bidirectional edges (parent, calls, called_by) for contextual chunks.
  - Combine results to provide primary chunks and their related context.
- **Graph Visualization Data**:
  - Expose Neo4j graph data (nodes and edges) via the MCP server for frontend visualization.
  - Include node properties (e.g., node type, file path) and edge types (e.g., parent-child, calls).
- **Output**: Context-aware chunk retrieval and graph data for visualization.

### 6. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server
- **Role**: Provide a standardized API endpoint for LLMs to query the codebase and retrieve context-aware results, serving as the primary interface for both the frontend and external LLMs.
- **Features**:
  - **Query Endpoint**: Accept natural language or code snippet queries, convert to embeddings using the selected model (cloud or local), and return primary chunks and contextual chunks.
  - **Graph Data Endpoint**: Retrieve Neo4j graph data (nodes and edges) for visualization or analysis.
  - **Model Selection**: Allow configuration of cloud or local AI model for embedding and query processing.
  - **Context Delivery**: Return structured responses with chunks, metadata, and related context (parent, calls, called_by).
- **Implementation**:
  - Built with FastAPI to provide RESTful endpoints.
  - Endpoints:
    - `/mcp/query`: Process queries, return chunks and context.
    - `/mcp/graph`: Retrieve graph data for visualization or LLM analysis.
    - `/mcp/status`: Check model availability (cloud API status or Ollama server status).
  - Support both cloud and local models via a modular interface.
  - Ensure compatibility with LLM requirements (e.g., JSON response format, context structure).
- **Output**: JSON responses with query results, graph data, and system status, consumable by LLMs and the frontend.

### 7. Chat Application Frontend
- **Framework**: Build with React and Tailwind CSS, using a single-page application (SPA) architecture.
- **Components**:
  - **Chat Interface**:
    - Input field for natural language or code snippet queries (e.g., “find authentication functions”).
    - Display area for search results, showing primary chunks and metadata (file path, line numbers).
    - Contextual results section to show related chunks (e.g., parent class, called functions).
    - Syntax highlighting for code snippets using `react-syntax-highlighter`.
  - **Graph Visualization View**:
    - Dedicated view to display the Neo4j graph of entity relationships.
    - Use Cytoscape.js to render nodes (chunks) and edges (parent-child, caller-callee).
    - Node details: Display node type, file path, and line numbers on hover or click.
    - Edge details: Label edges with type (e.g., “parent-child”, “calls”) and weight.
    - Interactive features: Zoom, pan, filter by node type or relationship.
  - **Model Selection**:
    - Dropdown or toggle to select cloud or local AI model for query processing.
    - Display model status via the MCP server’s `/mcp/status` endpoint.
- **Integration with MCP Server**:
  - Connect to the MCP server’s `/mcp/query` endpoint for search queries.
  - Fetch graph data from the `/mcp/graph` endpoint for visualization.
  - Handle real-time updates and error messages from the MCP server.
- **Output**: A user-friendly frontend for querying, testing, and visualizing codebase relationships, powered by the MCP server.

### 8. Dynamic LLM Integration with MCP Server
- **LLM Consumption**:
  - External LLMs (cloud or local) consume the MCP server’s `/mcp/query` endpoint to retrieve codebase knowledge.
  - Queries are processed using the configured AI model (cloud or local) for embedding generation.
  - Responses include primary chunks, metadata, and contextual chunks (parent, calls, called_by) in a structured JSON format.
- **Cloud AI Models**:
  - Query cloud-based LLMs (e.g., via xAI’s API) for processing results or generating responses.
  - Handle API authentication and rate limits.
- **Local AI Models**:
  - Use Ollama to process queries locally, ensuring compatibility with code-specific models.
  - Optimize for low-latency local inference.
- **Frontend Integration**:
  - The chat frontend uses the MCP server to send queries and display results, ensuring consistency with LLM interactions.
- **Output**: Seamless query processing and context retrieval for LLMs and the frontend via the MCP server.

### 9. Scalability and Extensibility
